# Cindral Product Roadmap

> **Last Updated:** December 20, 2025  
> **Status:** Active Development  
> **Current Phase:** Dashboard - Live Data (Workstream 3)
> **Goal:** Production-ready regulatory compliance platform

---

## 🎯 What We're Building

**Cindral** is a regulatory compliance intelligence platform that:

- Monitors regulations (DORA, GDPR, AI Act, Basel III)
- Maps regulations to IT systems
- Generates audit-ready evidence packs
- Alerts compliance teams to regulatory changes

**Why customers pay:** Fear of fines (DORA = up to €10M or 5% revenue), audit stress, compliance team burnout, lack of visibility across systems.
